# knn_from_scratch
Here I have programmed the KNN machine learning algorithm from scratch. It calculates for one or more selected data points in 1 to n-dimensional space the k nearest neighbors using the Euclidean distance. The class of the selected data point(s) to be predicted, will be determined by using majority voting for the classes of the k neighbors.
